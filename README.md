**Project Description: Personal Portfolio Website**
The Personal Portfolio Website is a custom-built, responsive, and interactive web application created to serve as a digital resume and personal branding tool. It is designed with a clean UI and dark theme to provide a modern aesthetic and user-friendly experience.

**Purpose & Objective**
The main purpose of this website is to showcase the developer’s skills, experience, and completed projects in a structured and visually appealing format. It serves as a central hub for recruiters, collaborators, and potential employers to explore your work, contact you, and follow your professional journey.
**Key Features & Structure**
**Navigation Bar with Dropdown Contact Info**
A responsive navbar includes links to various sections such as Home, LinkedIn, GitHub, Projects, LeetCode, and Contact.
The Contact link contains a dropdown menu built using JavaScript, which displays Email, Phone Number, and Location when clicked. This improves accessibility and user interaction without cluttering the main interface.

This section gives a powerful first impression. It includes:
A welcome message
Your name with a highlighted title (“Frontend Developer”)
A short professional bio
A profile image with soft shadows and rounded corners for a clean, professional look

Dark-themed background (#0f0f0f) with bright accent color (#ff1f8f) for highlights
Clean typography using Segoe UI
Responsive layout with Flexbox and media queries for mobile compatibility

**Dropdown Interactivity (JavaScript)**

Ensures smooth and intuitive user experience without reloading the page
